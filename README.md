# CSE-121-Project
A c++ program that accepts up to 100x100 matrices to perform multiple operations on them.
### These operations include:
    1. Addition and Subtraction
    2. Multiplication
    3. Finding the Transpose matrix
    4. Raising a matrix to an exponent
    5. Finding the determinant for a matrix
### Note that the calculator operates on matrices formatted in the following mattter:
[ a b c; d e f; g h i;] where this matrix is a 3 by 3 square matrix.
**The project is written in C++ and made use of the CPP STL.
